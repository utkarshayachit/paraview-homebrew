paraview-homebrew
=================

== EXPERIMENTAL = UNDER DEVELOPMENT ===

Homebrew build scripts for ParaView.

This is just a start. Works on 10.9.
Next, need to add support for options, SDK etc.

Install as follows:

    brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/utkarshayachit/paraview-homebrew/master/paraview.rb
    
You may need to add the following taps for dependencies:

    brew tap homebrew/science
    


TODO
----

* CGNS
* NumPy, Matplotlib
* SDK
* command-line tools only
